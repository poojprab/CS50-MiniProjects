                    <h3>Blueberry Pie</h3>
                    <p>Blueberry pie is a pie with a blueberry filling. Blueberry pie is readily made because it does not require pitting or peeling of fruit. It usually has a top and bottom crust. The top crust can be circular, but the pie can also have a crumble crust or no top crust.  Blueberry pies are often eaten in the summertime when blueberries are in season in the Northern hemisphere.</p>

                    <h3>Apple Pie</h3>
                    <p>An apple pie is a pie in which the principal filling ingredient is apples. The earliest printed recipe is from England. Apple pie is often served with whipped cream, ice cream ("apple pie à la mode"), or cheddar cheese.[3] It is generally double-crusted, with pastry both above and below the filling; the upper crust may be solid or latticed (woven of crosswise strips).</p>
