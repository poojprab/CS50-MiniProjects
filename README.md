# CS50-MiniProjects
This repository contains my work from Weeks 1 through 6 of Harvard's CS50 Introduction to Computer Science online course. This includes beginner level programming challenges
written in C and Python. 

# Skills acquired: 
Through the first 6 weeks of this course I was able to get a first look at handling memory, writing algorithms, and basic data structures associated with C and Python. This 
was the foundation that set me up for higher level computer science classes.
