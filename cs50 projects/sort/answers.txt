sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?: The run time significantly decreased between sorting the random5000 and the sorted5000 and bubble sort's runtime decreases from n^2 to n in the same way.

sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?: The run time did not significantly increase when switching between the random5000 and random10000, this is expected with the merge sort since the runtime graph is that of a log graph, which does not increase by much as well.

sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?: Since I already knew that sort1 was bubble, I chose the sort that had a runtime that increased more significantly when switching between random5000 and random10000.
